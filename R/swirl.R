#' An interactive learning environment for R and statistics.
#' 
#' This function presents a choice of course modules and interactively
#' tutors a user through them. A user may be asked to watch a video, to
#' answer a multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blanks question, or to
#' enter a command in the R console precisely as if he or she were 
#' using R in practice. Emphasis is on the last, interacting with the
#' R console. User responses are tested for correctness and hints are
#' given if appropriate. Progress is automatically saved so that a user
#' may quit at any time and later resume without losing work.
#' 
#' There are several ways to exit swirl: by typing \code{bye()} while in the R
#' console, by hitting the Esc key while not in the R console, or by
#' entering 0 from the swirl course menu. swirl will print a goodbye 
#' message whenever it exits. 
#' 
#' While swirl is in operation, it may be controlled by entering special
#' commands in the R console. One of the special commands is \code{bye()} 
#' as discussed above. Others are \code{play()}, \code{nxt()}, \code{skip()},
#' and \code{info()}. The parentheses are important.
#' 
#' Sometimes a user will want to play around in the R console without
#' interference or commentary from swirl. This can be accomplished by
#' using the special command \code{play()}. swirl will remain in operation,
#' silently, until the special command \code{nxt()} is entered.
#' 
#' The special command \code{skip()} can be used to skip a question if 
#' necessary. swirl will enter the correct answer and notify the
#' user of the names of any new variables which it may have created
#' in doing so. These may be needed for subsequent questions.
#' 
#' Finally, \code{info()} may be used to display a list of the special commands
#' themselves with brief explanations of what they do.

## SPECIAL COMMANDS

#' Exit swirl.
#' 
#' swirl operates by installing a callback function which responds
#' to commands entered in the R console. This is how it captures
#' and tests answers given by the user in the R console. swirl will
#' remain in operation until this callback is removed, which is
#' what \code{bye()} does.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' 
#' | Create a new variable called `x` that contains the number 3.
#' 
#' > bye()
#' 
#' | Leaving swirl now. Type swirl() to resume.
#' }
bye <- function(){
  removeTaskCallback("mini")
  swirl_out("Leaving swirl now. Type swirl() to resume.", skip_after=TRUE)
  invisible()
}

#' Begin the upcoming question or unit of instruction.
#' 
#' This is the way to regain swirl's attention after viewing
#' a video or \code{play()}'ing around in the console. 
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' 
#' | Create a new variable called `y` that contains the number 8.
#' 
#' > play()
#' 
#' | Entering play mode. Experiment as you please, then type nxt()
#' | when you ready to resume the lesson.
#' 
#' > 10/14
#' > [1] 0.7142857
#' > zz <- 99
#' > zz
#' > [1] 99
#' > nxt()
#' 
#' | Resuming lesson...
#' }
nxt <- function(){invisible()}

#' Skip the current unit of instruction.
#' 
#' swirl will enter the correct answer and notify the
#' user of the names of any new variables which it may have created
#' in doing so. These may be needed for subsequent questions.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' 
#' | Create a new variable called `y` that contains the number 8.
#' 
#' > skip()
#' 
#' | I've entered the correct answer for you.
#' 
#' | In doing so, I've created the variable(s) y, which you may need later.
#' }
skip <- function(){invisible()}

#' Tell swirl to ignore console input for a while.
#' 
#' It is sometimes useful to play around in the R console out of
#' curiosity or to solidify a concept. This command will cause
#' swirl to remain idle, allowing the user to experiment at will,
#' until the command \code{nxt()} is entered. 
#' @export

## RESUME METHOD

# if necessary. The three instructions are themselves S3 methods which 
# depend on the class of the active row of the course module. The 
# instruction set is thus extensible. It can be found in R/instructionSet.R.
