\title{Test for a correct expression, a correct value, or both.}
\usage{
omnitest(correctExpr = NULL, correctVal = NULL, strict = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{correctExpr}{the correct or expected expression as
  a string}

  \item{correctVal}{the correct value (numeric or
  character)}

  \item{strict}{a logical value indicating that the
  expression should be as expected even if the value is
  correct. If FALSE (the default) a correct value will pass
  the test even if the expression is not as expected, but a
  notification will be issued.}
}
\description{
Omnitest can test for a correct expression, a correct value,
or both. In the case of values it is limited to testing for
character or numerical vectors of length 1. For course authors
only, omnitest is not exported.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # Test that a user has chosen a correct menu item
  #
  omnitest(correctVal='Men in a college dorm.')

  # Test that a user has entered a correct number at the
  # command line
  #
  omnitest(correctVal=19)

  # Test that a user has entered a particular command
  #
  omnitest('myVar <- c(3, 5, 7)')

  # Test that a user has entered a command which computes
  # a specific value but perhaps in a different manner
  # than anticipated
  #
  omnitest('sd(x)^2', 5.95)
  #
  # If the user enters sd(x)*sd(x), rather than sd(x)^2, a notification
  # will be issued, but the test will not fail.

  # Test that a user has entered a command which computes
  # a specific value in a particular way
  #
  omnitest('sd(x)^2', 5.95, strict=TRUE)
  #
  # In this case, if the user enters sd(x)*sd(x) the test will fail.
