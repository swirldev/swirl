================================================================

--- &text

This is a block of text, denoted above by "--- &text". Blocks of text will be displayed to the user and do not require any input other than pressing Return to continue to the next block.

--- &cmd_question

This is a command question, denoted above by "--- &cmd_question". Command questions require the user to enter a valid R expression at the prompt. As an example, let's have the user store the result of `3 + 7` in a new variable called `z`.

```{r}
z <- 3 + 7  # This is an R expression that will answer the question correctly
```

*** .hint
This is a hint, which the user will see if he or she answers the question incorrectly. In this case, we might be kind and suggest that they type `z <- 3 + 7`.

*** .ans_tests
Answer tests go here. If omitted, the default answer test requires the user to enter the same R expression you specified in the code chunk above. See swirl documentation for more details about answer testing.

--- &mult_question

This is a multiple choice question, denoted by "--- &mult_question". Here we might ask which function can be used to compute the sum of 2 or more numbers.

_1. `sum()`_
2. `mean()`
3. `abs()`

*** .hint
This is a hint, which will be displayed after an incorrect response to the question. In this example, we could tell the user that the function name is synonymous with "addition".
