"text","The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple data types. We'll explore atomic vectors further before we get to lists.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at logical and character vectors.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","Logical vectors can contain the values `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NA` (for ""not available""). These values are generated as the result of logical ""conditions"". Let's experiment with some simple conditions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","First, create a numeric vector `num_vect` that contains the values 0.5, 55, -10, and 6.","num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)",NA,"expr_identical=num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)","Recall that the `c()` function is used for creating a vector. If you forget how to use it, use `?c` to access the help file. Don't forget to assign the result to a new variable called `num_vect`.",NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Now, create a variable called `tf` that gets the result of `num_vect < 1`, which is read as ""num_vect is less than 1"".","tf <- num_vect < 1",NA,"expr_identical=tf <- num_vect < 1","Use `tf <- num_vect < 1` to assign the result of `num_vect < 1` to a variable called `tf`.",NA,NA,NA
"mult_question","What do you think `tf` will look like?","a vector of 4 logical values","a vector of 4 logical values; a single logical value","word=a vector of 4 logical values","Remember our lesson on vector arithmetic? The theme was that R performs many operations on an element-by-element basis. We called these ""vectorized"" operations.",NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Print the contents of `tf` now.","tf",NA,"expr_identical=tf","Just type `tf` and press Enter to view the its value.",NA,NA,NA
"text","The statement `num_vect < 1` is a condition and `tf` tells us whether each corresponding element of our numeric vector `num_vect` satisfies this condition.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","The first element of `num_vect` is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the statement 0.5 < 1 is `TRUE`. The second element of `num_vect` is 55, which is greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is `FALSE`. The same logic applies for the third and forth elements.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Let's try another. Type `num_vect >= 6` without assigning the result to a new variable.","num_vect >= 6",NA,"expr_identical=num_vect >= 6","Don't create a new variable on this one. We just want to see the result of `num_vect >= 6`. Make sure there is no space between the `>` and `=` symbols. Think of them as one symbol representing ""greater than or equal to"".",NA,NA,NA
"text","This time, we are asking whether each individual element of `num_vect` is greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to 6, the second and forth elements of the result are `TRUE` and the first and third elements are `FALSE`.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called ""logical operators"". Other logical operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=` for inequality.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","If we have two logical expressions, `A` and `B`, we can ask whether at least one is `TRUE` with `A | B` (logical ""or"" a.k.a. ""union"") or whether they are both `TRUE` with `A & B` (logical ""and"" a.k.a. ""intersection""). Lastly, `!A` is the negation of `A` and is `TRUE` when `A` is `FALSE` and vice versa.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","It's a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations of these logical operators until you get comfortable with their use. We'll do a few examples here to get you started.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","Try your best to predict the result of each of the following statements. You can use pencil and paper to work them out if it's helpful. If you get stuck, just guess and you've got a 50% chance of getting the right answer!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There's also an ""order of operations"" going on here. Conditions that are enclosed within parentheses should be evaluated first. Then, work your way outwards.",NA,NA,NA
"text","Don't worry if you found these to be tricky. They're supposed to be. Working with logical statements in R takes practice, but your efforts will be rewarded in future lessons (e.g. subsetting and control structures).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to distinguish character objects, as in the following example.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Create a character vector that contains the following words: ""My"", ""name"", ""is"".

"text","Right now, `my_char` is a character vector of length 3. Let's say we want to join the elements of `my_char` together into one continuous character string (i.e. a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the `paste()` function.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

You'll see why in a second.","paste(my_char, collapse = "" "")",NA,"expr_identical=paste(my_char, collapse = "" "")","Use `paste(my_char, collapse = "" "")` to collapse the words in the vector so they almost form a sentence. There should be a single space between the double quotes in the `collapse` argument so that there are single spaces separating the words.",NA,NA,NA

"cmd_question","In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try `paste(""Hello"", ""world!"", sep = "" "")`, where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements with a single space.","paste(""Hello"", ""world!"", sep = "" "")",NA,"expr_identical=paste(""Hello"", ""world!"", sep = "" "")","Enter `paste(""Hello"", ""world!"", sep = "" "")` to join the two words ""Hello"" and ""world"", separated by a single space.

Use `paste()` to join the numeric vector `1:3` (recall this is the same as `c(1, 2, 3)`) with the character vector `c(""X"", ""Y"", ""Z"")`.
