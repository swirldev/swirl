"text","This is a brief demonstration of function omnitest. Omnitest can grade student answers for a correct expression, a correct value, or both. In the case of values it is limited to testing for character or numerical vectors of length 1. Omnitest's general signature is: omnitest(correctExpr=NULL, correctVal=NULL, strict=FALSE)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"mult_question","First, I'll use omnitest(correctVal='Mamma Mia!') for the answer to a multiple choice question: Which movie involves Pierce Brosnan in a singing role?","Mamma Mia!","Mamma Mia!;Guys and Dolls;Once is Not Enough","omnitest(correctVal='Mamma Mia!')","In Guys and Dolls, Marlon Brando sings. In Once is Not Enough, 007 doesn't.",NA,NA,NA
"exact_question","Next, I'll use omnitest(correctVal=3) for an exact numerical answer entered at the command line: How many Stooges are there?","3",NA,"omnitest(correctVal=3)","This one should be obvious! Nyuk, Nyuk, Nyuk!",NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Now I'll use omnitest(correctExpr='scooby <- c(1969, 2013)') to test that a user has entered a particular command: Enter scooby <- c(1969, 2013)","scooby <- c(1969, 2013)",NA,"omnitest(correctExpr='scooby <- c(1969, 2013)')","So far, Scooby has been on the air or in theaters from 1969 to 2013. Enter scooby <- c(1969, 2013)",NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Omnitest has strict and casual modes. I'll demonstrate casual, the default, by using omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9) to test that a user has entered a command which computes a specific value but perhaps in a different manner than anticipated. The correct expression is 3^2, but enter 3*3.","3^2",NA,"omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9)","Enter 3^2",NA,NA,NA
"cmd_question","Finally, I'll demonstrate strict mode for same question, using omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9, strict=TRUE) to test that a user has entered a command which computes a specific value in a particular way. The correct expression is 3^2. Entering 3*3 should fail.","3^2",NA,"omnitest(correctExpr='3^2', correctVal=9, strict=TRUE)","Enter 3^2",NA,NA,NA
"text","That completes the omnitest test. Thank you.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
