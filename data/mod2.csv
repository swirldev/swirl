"text","Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we will learn what DISPERSION is and what statistical values are needed in order to best describe the spread of data. Further, you will learn all about a box-and-whisker plot which is  a plot commonly used by Statisticians when determining variability. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","While measures of central tendency are used to estimate the middle values of a dataset, measures of dispersion are important for describing the spread of the data. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dispersion",NA
"text","The term dispersion refers to degree to which the data values are scattered around an average value. Dispersion is synonymous with other words such as variability and the spread.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dispersion",NA
"text","Why is it important to analyze the spread of a particular set of data? Two different samples may have the same mean or median, but different levels of variability or vice versa. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dispersion",NA
"question","Therefore, it is important to describe both the __________ and _________ of a data set. ","multiple","median, variability; central tendency, dispersion; middle, mean; spread, variability","central tendency, dispersion","The first term refers to the middle of a dataset. The second term refers to the spread of a dataset.",NA,NA,NA,"dispersion",NA
"text","In this module, we will discuss the three statistical values most commonly used to describe the dispersion or variability of a data set. Variability is a fancy term used to classify how variable or spread out the data is. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"text","The first descriptive statistic that can describe the variability of a data set is known as the RANGE. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the data set. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA
"text","To demonstrate how you can use R to determine the range of a data set we will refer back to the cars data set from the previous module. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"range",NA
"question","Type in the R-command 'range(cars$price)' to determine the exact values for the minimum and maximum prices of cars in the data set. ","command",NA,"range(cars$price)","Type in 'range(cars$price)' without quotations and press enter to see the minimum and maximum prices. ",NA,NA,NA,"range",NA
"question","Now that you have the minimum and maximum 'price' values, calculate the range of the 'price' data. ","exact",NA,"54.5","Subtract the minimum price value from the maximum price value.",NA,NA,NA,"range",NA
"text","The second important measure of variability is known as VARIANCE. Mathematically, VARIANCE is the average of the squared differences from the mean. More simply, variance represents the total distance of the data from the mean.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"variance",NA
"question","In R, you can use the command 'var(data)' to easily calculate the variance of a particular set of data. Try calculating the variance for the data 'cars$price'. ","command",NA,"var(cars$price)","Type in 'var(cars$price)' without quotations and press enter to see the variance of the prices of cars.",NA,NA,NA,"variance",NA
"text","The values for variance and standard deviation are very closely related. The standard deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance where as the variance can be calculated by squaring the standard deviation. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"standard deviation",NA
"text","To Statisticians, the standard deviation is a more conventional measure of variability because it is expressed in the same units as the original data values.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"standard deviation",NA
"question","Similar to variance, you can use the R-command 'sd(data)' to calculate the standard deviation of a particular set of data. Try calculating the standard deviation for the data 'cars$price'.","command",NA,"sd(cars$price)","Type in 'sd(cars$price)' without quotations and press enter to see the standard deviation of the prices of cars.",NA,NA,NA,"standard deviation",NA
"question","Using the relationship between standard deviation and variance described above, use a different method and your standard deviation value calculated for the data 'cars$price' to find the variance. ","command",NA,"sd(cars$price)^2","Square your standard deviation value calculated for the prices of cars.",NA,NA,NA,"standard deviation",NA
"text","The value for variance is very important when analyzing our data set. A low value for variance indicates that the data points tend to be located near the mean value; a high value for variance indicates that the data points are spread further from the mean.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"variance",NA
"video","Would you like to watch a short video that goes deeper into how variance and standard deviation are calculated? ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://youtu.be/E4HAYd0QnRc","dispersion",NA
"question","Three important measures of variability are which of the following: ","multiple","mean, median, range; spread, mean, central tendency; variance, dispersion, spread; range, variance, standard deviation","range, variance, standard deviation","Look for the three specific terms that we focused on calculating. ",NA,NA,NA,"dispersion",NA
"text","A BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER PLOT, is used to summarize the main descriptive statistics of a particular data set and this type of plot helps illustrate this concept of variability. A box plot is used to visually represent the MINIMUM, FIRST QUARTILE (Q1), MEDIAN, THIRD QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of a data set.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"box-and-whisker plot",NA
"video","Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on box-and-whisker plots?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://youtu.be/BXq5TFLvsVw","box-and-whisker plot",NA
"figure","Here I have created a box plot to represent the price data for each of the three car types: large, midsize, and small. You'll notice that each of the 3 figures is composed of a closed 4-sided ""box"" with ""whiskers"" on the top and bottom, hence the name box-and-whisker plot.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_boxplot.R","new",NA,"box-and-whisker plot",NA
"text","The height of each box is referred to as the INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR). The more variability within the data, the larger the IQR. On the other hand, less variability within the data means a smaller IQR. The bottom of the box in the box plot corresponds to the value of the first quartile (Q1), and the top of the box corresponds to the value of the third quartile (Q3). To calculate the value of the IQR, simply subtract the value of Q1 from that of Q3.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"interquartile range",NA
"text","The whiskers, or lines, that extend above and below each box represent roughly the upper 25% and lower 25% of data points, respectively. The only exception is when there are outliers, which I'll explain shortly.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"interquartile range",NA
"question","Looking at the box plot, what is the approximate interquartile range for the midsize vehicles?","range",NA,"16; 22","Subtract the Q1 value from the Q3 value. The Q1 value is the minimum value contained in the box and the Q3 value is the maximum value contained in the box.",NA,NA,NA,"interquartile range",NA
"text","Let's take a closer look at how quartiles are calculated. We start by sorting the data from least to greatest, just like when calculating the median. The first quartile (Q1), also known at the 25th PERCENTILE (since 25% of the data points fall at or below this value), is simply the median of the first half of the sorted data. Likewise, the third quartile (Q3), also known as the 75th percentile, is the median of the second half of the sorted data.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"interquartile range",NA
"figure","As shown in this plot, the blue horizontal line illustrates how to find the value for the first quartile. The green horizontal line illustrates how to find the value for the third quartile. The interquartile range is the range of data values that is contained in between these two lines.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_boxplot_add.R","addition",NA,"interquartile range",NA
"figure","Look again at our box plot of price vs. car type. You may be thinking to yourself, 'What is that circle above the box plots for the midsize cars, and why is there no circle above the box plot for the large cars?' Those circles represent OUTLIERS in the data set. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_boxplot.R","new",NA,"outlier",NA
"figure","An OUTLIER is an observation that is unusual or extreme relative to the other values in the data set. Outliers are useful in identifying a heavy skew in a distribution, and may signify a data collection or data entry error to a scientist. There are many different conventions for identifying outliers within a data set.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_boxplot.R","new",NA,"outlier",NA
"question","When looking at the box plot, which car types appear to have outliers? Separate your answers with a comma.","text",NA,"small, midsize","Look for the types of cars that correspond to the box plots with circles above or below them.",NA,NA,NA,"outlier",NA
"figure","As you can see in the box plot, the data for prices of 'midsize' cars vary from around 15 to 62, encompassing a range of approximately 50. This is a great deal larger than the variation for 'small' cars which range from around 5 to 15, encompassing a range of approximately 10. Therefore, since the range is much greater for 'midsize' cars, prices of 'midsize' cars have much higher variability in comparison to the prices of 'small' cars.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"mod1_boxplot.R","new",NA,"variability",NA
"question","Now it is your turn! Is the variability of prices of cars of type 'large' higher or lower than that of cars of type 'small'?","text",NA,"higher","Look to see if the range of cars of type 'large' is greater or less than that of cars of type 'small'.",NA,NA,NA,"variability",NA
"text","You have officially mastered the concept of dispersion and have fully learned how to read and interpret a box-and-whisker plot. These are two very valuable tools used everyday in descriptive statistics. Congratulations! In the next module, you will learn about data visualization. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
